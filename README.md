# 🛡️ PhishBuster AI

**PhishBuster AI** is an intelligent phishing detection suite powered by machine learning, built to detect malicious **URLs** and **emails**, with transparency through **SHAP explainability** — all accessible via a clean, interactive Streamlit web interface.

🌐 **Live App**: [https://phishbuster-ai-10.streamlit.app](https://phishbuster-ai-10.streamlit.app)

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 Detect **phishing URLs** using XGBoost
- 📧 Identify **phishing emails** with a BERT + Logistic Regression ensemble
- 📊 Visualize predictions using **SHAP explainability**
- 📁 Upload CSVs for **bulk analysis** of URLs and emails
- 🎯 Built using **Streamlit** for an intuitive user interface
